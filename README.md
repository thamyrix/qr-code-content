# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This is my first project ever, so it was a great experience to practice some of the lessons that i've been learning. 

###Update
I've submitted this project on Frontend Mentor, received some advices and I updated the code, specially adding the <main> and media query, making it responsive for mobile and desktop.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

  

### What I learned

In this project, I had some difficulty aligning elements and with margin. In this process, I've learned how to take off all margins to start customizing and how to centralize the elements in the center of the page.

```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
	box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

```css
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
```

### Continued development

As my first project, I've realized that I've a lot to improve, specially, in css and flexbox. For now on, I'll practice with others projects and put more efforts on studying.
